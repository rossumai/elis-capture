# Elis Capture (WIP)

Mobile app, that let's you upload your documents to [Elis](https://rossum.ai/data-capture) with a snap of your finger. Both iOS and Android supported.

**Watch out! This version of expo has a bug. If you're using Android, Async Storage may not work all the times. If you're having trouble with signing in, consider restarting the expo app in your phone.**
